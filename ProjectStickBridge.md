# Project: Stick Bridge Building (Dare You if it Falls)

## What?
You'll be constructing a bridge using ice-cream sticks and glue, but with a twist! No traditional designs allowed here—get creative with your constructions. Experiment with various designs to determine which one can bear the most weight before collapsing. 🌉

## How?
### Step 1: Building the Bridge
- **Utilize** ice-cream sticks and glue to craft your bridge.
- **Embrace creativity** and explore unconventional designs.
- **Test the structural integrity** of each design by assessing its ability to withstand weight. 🛠️

### Step 2: Adding Payload
- **Once your bridge is built,** stack it with a payload to assess its utility.
- Consider the **center of gravity** and the **overall structural integrity** as you add weight to your creation. 🏋️‍♂️
